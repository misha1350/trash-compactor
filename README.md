# Trash-Compactor
  A utility for intelligent file compression on Windows 10/11 systems using the built-in NTFS compression algorithms and Windows' built-in "compact.exe" utility. Unlike [CompactGUI](https://github.com/IridiumIO/CompactGUI) (another tool that is based on compact.exe and primarily designed for compressing Steam games), this utility automatically selects the optimal compression algorithm based on file size - this lets you squeeze the most out of the compression algorithms and get even smaller file sizes, all while avoiding unnecessary compression, keeping things DRY (also known as "Don't Repeat Yourself").

  ## Features

  - Automated compression using Windows NTFS compression
  - Smart algorithm selection based on file size
  - Always-on entropy sampling to avoid cache and high-entropy media directories
  - Configurable minimum savings threshold (`--min-savings`) with interactive controls
  - Multiple operation modes for different use cases
  - Skips poorly-compressed file formats (zip, media files, etc.)
  - Skips already-compressed files
  - Detailed compression statistics and per-run throughput metrics

  ## Requirements

  - Windows 10/11
  - Administrator privileges

## Installation

### Option 1: Using the Executable (Recommended)

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/misha1350/trash-compactor/releases/latest)
2. Run the executable file

### Option 2: Running from Source

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Clone and navigate to the repository:
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/misha1350/trash-compactor.git
    cd trash-compactor
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```powershell
    python main.py
    ```

Note: For Option 2, ensure Git and Python 3.8+ are installed on your system.

Optional: you can compile the app yourself as I did, using PyInstaller:
    ```
    python -m PyInstaller --onefile --name trash-compactor --uac-admin main.py 
    ```
    or
    ```
    python -m PyInstaller --onefile --name trash-compactor --uac-admin main.py --upx-dir 'c:\path\to\upx-win64'
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the program as Administrator.
2. Enter the directory path you want to compress.
3. The program will automatically:
    - Scan all files recursively
    - Skip incompatible files
    - Apply optimal compression algorithms
    - Display compression statistics

### Interactive configuration

Launching without arguments opens an interactive shell that lets you browse to the target directory, toggle flags, and adjust the minimum savings threshold before starting.

- Enter a path directly, optionally followed by flags (for example: `D:\Games -vx`).
- Use `--min-savings=<percent>` to change the skip threshold on the fly, or rely on the default 10% savings.
- Press `S` or hit enter on an empty line to begin once the directory and flags look good.

### Operation Modes

Trash-Compactor offers three distinct operation modes to handle different scenarios:

#### Normal Mode (Default)
For first-time compression of directories with optimal performance.
Most users can just compress once and forget about it.
Be aware that temporarily disabling the anti-virus or whitelisting this program is going to greatly improve the compression speed.
```powershell
.\trash-compactor.exe C:\path\to\compress
```

#### Thorough Mode (-t)
For daily or scheduled compression tasks on directories that have already been compressed. Uses more intensive checking to accurately identify compressed files and avoid reprocessing (because Windows doesn't have reliable and fast methods to check if some files have been compressed before).
Be aware that this mode heavily uses the fastest CPU core in your system, so systems with bad cooling or hot Intel CPUs may run hot.
```powershell
.\trash-compactor.exe -t C:\path\to\compress
```

#### Branding Mode (-b)
For ensuring proper marking of files as compressed in Windows. Run this after initial compression if you plan to do daily or scheduled compression tasks, either after the Thorough Mode or after that.
```powershell
.\trash-compactor.exe -b C:\path\to\compress
```

### Recommended Workflow for Scheduled Compression

For optimal results when running compression tasks regularly (daily/weekly):

1. **Initial compression**: Run in normal mode
   ```powershell
   .\trash-compactor.exe C:\path\to\compress
   ```

2. **Branding**: Run in branding mode to properly mark all files
   ```powershell
   .\trash-compactor.exe -b C:\path\to\compress
   ```

3. **For ongoing daily/scheduled tasks**: Use thorough mode aftwewards
   ```powershell
   .\trash-compactor.exe -t C:\path\to\compress
   ```

### Additional Options

- `-v, --verbose`: Show cache exclusion decisions with entropy sampling (supports up to `-vvvv` for debug logs)
- `-x, --no-lzx`: Disable LZX compression for better system responsiveness
- `-f, --force-lzx`: Force LZX compression even on less capable CPUs
- `--min-savings <percent>`: Set the minimum estimated savings (0-90, default 10). Directories predicted to save less are skipped automatically.

## To-Do

### Short-term Goals
- Land a default exclusion map for Windows/system directories, emit skip reasons, and surface toggles for future overrides
- Persist user overrides and low-yield directory notes to a lightweight JSON/INI profile so unattended runs inherit past decisions
- Expand cache heuristics for well-known applications (Chromium/Electron/Telegram/Teams, etc.) ahead of entropy analysis
- Record poorly compressible hits in the info log to build a reusable "do not touch" ledger during normal runs
- Add basic test suite for core functionality
  - Implement a single-thread benchmark to check if the CPU is fast enough to use LZX (to check if the CPU is not an Intel Atom with numerous, but weak cores)
  - Test compression detection accuracy
  - Verify that API calls work correctly
  - Check error handling paths

### Long-term Goals
- Create a 1-click/unattended mode of operation built on the recorded skip map:
  - Automatically discover large folders (replacing WizTree and having to manually scour through folders)
  - Avoid compressing specific folders, such as ones mentioned in short-term goals
  - Make life easier for The Greatest Technicians That Have Ever Lived
- Implement smart compression detection that can make decisions without touching the filesystem twice:
  - Use entropy analysis for compressibility estimation
  - Sample data chunks strategically
  - Cache results per file type
  - Add file type detection beyond extensions, i.e. based on file content
    - Compress easily compressable files (based on the extension first), then decide what to do with potentially problematic files later
- Quality of Life features:
  - More coloured output
  - Saving user configuration with an optional `.ini` file
  - Add resume capability for interrupted operations
  - Add option to generate detailed reports in various formats
- Localization support depending on system language
- Research advanced compression methods:
  - Evaluate alternative NTFS compression APIs, like [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx)
  - Consider filesystem-agnostic approaches (moving compressed files in/out of the source drive unpacks them)
  - Benchmark different compression strategies
  - Research possibilities for custom compression algorithms
  - Investigate integration with other Windows compression features
- Security and Reliability:
  - Implement proper error handling for network paths
  - Add verification of filesystem compatibility
